# Z-Cupid

This was the project we developed for our Hackathon, the final event of our programming bootcamp.
In 24 hours we had to come up with the idea, execute it and present it to our fellow Code Cadets, Master Coders, IT company representatives and more.

// The idea

  At the beggining of the Hackathon, our Master Coders gave us a theme and 24h hours to develop a project related to that theme. In the case of our team, the theme simply was: "Jos√© Cid e o amor".
  
  Taking the idea of love and how an artist singing about love can make such a strong impact. Therefore, we decided to develop a "Love" web app, where lovers could share and be in contact, no matter the distance.  
  
  This project was hard for a variety of reasons, first off all, the time limit. A hackathon can make a person feel really tired thanks to the lack of sleep, even so, we managed to provide an MVP product, which fullfiled the group with imense pride.
  
  Some of the services we provide in this web app are:
  
  - A sign in and log in form (for a couple).
  - A counter for time, marking the latest visit, plus the a counter of the time marking how long the couple has been together.
  - Daily relationship tips and advices that keeps updating.
  - Relationship's goals, essencially goals that the couple have to spend more time together, no matter the distance between them. (e.x: Watching a movie, taking about specific topics, or play some online game together).
